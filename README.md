# Scriptorium

The primary objective of the project is to create a Library Information System. This Library Information System provides two front ends; an open user front end and a restricted admin front end. This project intends to be used in a scenario of a conventional library, where books are to be borrowed and returned physically (and one needs admin rights to access these parts of the system) while the books can be renewed online by the users themselves.
